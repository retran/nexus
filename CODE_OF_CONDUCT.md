# Contributor Covenant 3.0 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the
**Nexus** community a welcoming, safe, and equitable experience for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the
dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of
characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical
characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or
social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The
same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in
good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our
community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our
words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on
culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each
other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

- Respecting the purpose of our community, our activities, and our ways of
  gathering.
- Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
- Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
- Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our
  community.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances,
threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of
Conduct.

- **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in
  unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
- **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments
  directed at a community member or group of people.
- **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone's personality or
  behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
- **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered
  inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
- **Violating confidentiality.** Sharing or acting on someone's personal or
  private information without their permission.
- **Endangerment.** Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm
  toward any person or group.
- Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their
best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation,
and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help
avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a
possible violation, please email the project maintainers at
**[me@retran.me](mailto:me@retran.me)**. This inbox is private and monitored by
the project lead.

Project maintainers take reports of violations seriously and will make every
effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of code
of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing
witnesses and other participants. Project maintainers will keep investigation
and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and
confidentiality.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation by the project maintainers finds that this Code of Conduct
has been violated, the following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how
best to repair harm, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved
and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower
rungs on the ladder may be skipped.

### 1. Warning

- **Event**: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.
- **Consequence**: A private, written warning from the project maintainers.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair include a private written apology,
  acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.

### 2. Temporarily Limited Activities

- **Event**: A repeated incidence of a violation that previously resulted in a
  warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.
- **Consequence**: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown
  period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation. The cooldown
  period may be limited to particular communication channels or interactions
  with particular community members.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the
  cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about
  re-entering community spaces after the period is over.

### 3. Temporary Suspension

- **Event**: A pattern of repeated violation which the project maintainers have
  tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.
- **Consequence**: A private written warning with conditions for return from
  suspension.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the
  suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful
  about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted.

### 4. Permanent Ban

- **Event**: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps
  on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the
  project maintainers determine there is no way to keep the community safe with
  this person as a member.
- **Consequence**: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication
  channels is removed.
- **Repair**: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all `Nexus` project spaces, and also applies
when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other
spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
